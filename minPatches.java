/*The question asked for the "minimum number of patches required". In other words, it asked for an optimal solution. Lots of problems involving optimal solution can be solved by dynamic programming and/or greedy algorithm. I started with greedy algorithm which is conceptually easy to design. Typically, a greedy algorithm needs selection of best moves for a subproblem. So what is our best move?

Think about this example: nums = [1, 2, 3, 9]. We naturally want to iterate through nums from left to right and see what we would discover. After we encountered 1, we know 1...1 is patched completely. After encountered 2, we know 1...3 (1+2) is patched completely. After we encountered 3, we know 1...6 (1+2+3) is patched completely. After we encountered 9, the smallest number we can get is 9. So we must patch a new number here so that we don't miss 7, 8. To have 7, the numbers we can patch is 1, 2, 3 ... 7. Any number greater than 7 won't help here. Patching 8 will not help you get 7. So we have 7 numbers (1...7) to choose from. I hope you can see number 7 works best here because if we chose number 7, we can move all the way up to 1+2+3+7 = 13. (1...13 is patched completely) and it makes us reach n as quickly as possible. After we patched 7 and reach 13, we can consider last element 9 in nums. Having 9 makes us reach 13+9 = 22, which means 1...22 is completely patched. If we still did't reach n, we can then patch 23, which makes 1...45 (22+23) completely patched. We continue until we reach n.*/
public class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        int p = 0, res = 0;
        long reach = 0; //the result might get out of the range of int
        while (reach < n) {
        	if (p >= nums.length || reach+1 < nums[p]) {
        		reach += (reach+1);
        		res++;
        	}
        	else {
        		reach += nums[p];
        		p++;
        	}
        }
        return res;
    }
