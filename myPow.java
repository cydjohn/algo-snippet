The basic idea is to decompose the exponent into powers of 2, so that you can keep dividing the problem in half. For example, lets say
N = 9 = 2^3 + 2^0 = 1001 in binary. Then:
x^9 = x^(2^3) * x^(2^0)

We can see that every time we encounter a 1 in the binary representation of N, we need to multiply the answer with x^(2^i) where i is the ith bit of the exponent. Thus, we can keep a running total of repeatedly squaring x - (x, x^2, x^4, x^8, etc) and multiply it by the answer when we see a 1.

To handle the case where N=INTEGER_MIN we use a long (64-bit) variable.
since you're dividing N by 2 every iteration that's why it is O(Log N). However, since N is a fixed number of bits (32) you could view it as O(1) where the maximum number iterations is 32. */
